### Hi, I'm Francesco ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer who is passionate about creating new stuff by using different technologies. </br>
I work especially with web technologies and I like very much the world around the web.</br>
When I can, I put myself in the game by participating to the challenges of competitive programming.


## Competitive Programming
This type of programming is very attractive to me because it allows me to improve my problem solving skill. </br>
I partecipated to the following competitions:
