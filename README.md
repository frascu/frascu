### Hi, I'm Francesco ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer.

## Competitive Programming
This type of programming is very attractive to me. </br>
Therefore several times I put myself in the game and I partecipated to:
* <b>Google Hash Code</b></br> Googleâ€™s team-based programming competition that allows you to share your skills and connect with other coders as you work together to solve a problem modeled off a real Google engineering challenge.
